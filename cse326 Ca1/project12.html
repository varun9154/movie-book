         Swami Vivekananda attained Mahasamadhi on July 4, 1902. On this day, 
he woke up early, went to Belur Math and meditated there for three hours.
After taking classes and discussing a planned Vedic college in Ramakrishna Math, 
he went to his room at 7 pm and asked not be disturbed.

       He died at 9:10 pm while meditating. Medically, a rupture of a blood 
vessel in his brain led to the death. His disciples believe that the rupture 
was due to brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced 
when he attained mahasamādhi.

         Finally,He was cremated on a sandalwood pyre on the banks of Ganga 
in Belur.
