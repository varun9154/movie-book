  Kattappa Killed Baahubali’ jokes are cracked around you and memes invoking the
  two land on your social media? Have you heard of SS Rajamouli’s Baahubali franchise
  but can’t figure out the adjectives it comes attached with? You have seen Prabhas 
  and Rana Daggubati’s ferocious transformation for Baahubali 2 and are non-plussed?
  Wondering why people have already marked April 28, 2017, Baahubali 2’s release date,
 in their calendars? Here are all the answers to Who is Baahubali and why Baahubali 2 is
  such a big deal.

   <h3>The story </h3>
 </center>
 <p3>
  The Kingdom of Mahishmati is ruled by queen Sivagami (Ramya) who is married to Bijjaladeva (Nassar). 
  She takes charge of the kingdom when Amarendra Baahubali’s (Prabhas) mother passes away during labour.
  She takes care of Amarendra like her own son and ensures that he is brought up with the ability to rule
  the kingdom one day. Amarendra Baahubali also has a cousin brother Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati) who 
  is Sivagami’s son by blood. With two sons and one kingdom to rule, Sivagami decides to test both her 
  sons. She challenges them to win the upcoming war against the Kalakeyas and promises that whoever is 
  victorious will be crowned the king.
  Meanwhile, Kuntala is attacked by Pindaris, a dacoit-like army. Amarendra, with the help of Kattappa,
  Devasena's maternal cousin, Kumara Varma, is able to nullify the attack and save Kuntala. Upon being 
  questioned, Amarendra reveals his true identity. He receives a bird post from Mahishmati, ordering 
  him to take Devasena as captive. He promises Devasena that he will protect her honour and convinces
  her to come with him to Mahishmati as his future bride.

<p4>
  Bijjaladeva convinces Kumara Varma that Bhallaladeva is after Amarendra's life and he must kill the 
  king to safeguard his brother-in-law. Kumara Varma enters the palace in the stealth of the night,only
  to be discovered by Bhallaladeva and be killed, but not before revealing their plot to convince Sivagami
  to kill Amarendra due to the people's continuing respect for him. Sivagami, convinced that Bhallaladeva's
  life is under threat but that open hostility would result in civil war, orders Kattappa to assassinate 
  Amarendra. Kattappa, bound by his word to serve the Queen, lures Amarendra by feigning he is in trouble, 
  and then stabs him in the back and kills him.
  After Amarendra's death, Kattappa soon learns of Bhallaladeva's treachery and informs Sivagami, who reveals
  to the panicked hordes outside her palace that Amarendra is dead and that the baby Mahendra Baahubali would 
  ascend the throne. As Bhallaladeva and his men are about to seize the queen, she flees with the new King but 
  falls into a river after being hit by an arrow shot by Bhallaladeva. Bhallaladeva becomes a tyrannical emperor
  who holds Devasena prisoner for the next 25 years and destroys Kuntala, Mahendra ends up in alliance with the 
  rebels who try to rescue her.

  <h4>Climax</h4>

<p5>
  After listening to the whole story, Mahendra Baahubali (alias Shivudu / Shiva) immediately declares war. 
  He assembles the rebel army, consisting of villagers and scattered soldiers. With Kattappa's and Avantika's 
  assistance, the army lays siege to Mahishmati. Bhallaladeva recaptures Devasena, but Kattappa, Mahendra, 
  and the rebels breach the city walls and save her. Mahendra fights his uncle and pins him down using the 
  chains from Devasena's cage. After completing a cleansing ritual Devasena burns Bhallaladeva on a pyre, 
  ending his reign permanently.
  The next day, Mahendra is crowned as the new king of Mahishmati with Avantika as his queen. He declares 
  Mahishmati will be dedicated to upholding peace and justice under his leadership. He also orders his men 
  to toss the head of Bhallaladeva's statue out of the palace walls, where it is swept to the great waterfall.It
  breaks as it falls and crashes against the cliff's walls and lands near the lingam that Mahendra carried earlier.
